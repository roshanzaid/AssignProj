PROJ GAMMA - CRUD Book Operations
Author: Roshan Zaid
Version: 1.0.2
=======================================================================================================================================================================

1. The project consists 2 projects:
	- React project (named : frontend) - which is responsible for all front end activities
	- Node Project (named : backend) - one is node project which acts a bridge between DB and the frontend. This consists the APIs which is used for the CRUD operations.

2. The database file can be imported to Mongo DB, named: books.json

=======================================================================================================================================================================
How it Happens?
=======================================================================================================================================================================

The node project is created with APIs and tested with postman the requests. for Each operation: 
            - VIEW: https://localhost:3000/books              (WITH A GET REQUEST)
            - VIEW SINGLE: https://localhost:3000/books/id=:  (WITH A GET REQUEST PASSING THE UNIQUE BOOK ID)
            - CREATE: https://localhost:3000/books            (WITH A POST REQUEST PASSING THE PARAMETERS)
            - UPDATE: https://localhost:3000/books/id=:       (WITH A PUT REQUEST PASSING THE UNIQUE BOOK ID)
            - DELETE: https://localhost:3000/books/id=:       (WITH A DELETE REQUEST PASSING THE UNIQUE BOOK ID)
            
The react project will be communicating with AXIOS in order to connect with these APIS and get the job done.

Several Node Modules has been used for styling and making use of code reusabilities.
  -Babel
  -MATERIAL CSS
  -AXIOS
  -MONGOOSE
  -NODEMON
